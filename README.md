<h2>Project Description</h2>

Flextally is an innovative fitness web app that leverages cutting-edge computer vision technology to provide real-time workout tracking, form feedback, and personalized goal setting, helping users stay motivated and achieve their fitness goals efficiently.

<h2>The Problem statement</h2>

In the fast-paced digital age, many individuals face challenges in maintaining consistent fitness routines due to the lack of accessible, user-friendly, and cost-effective workout solutions. Existing fitness applications often rely on expensive wearables, require manual input for tracking, or fail to provide real-time feedback, resulting in less engaging and less effective fitness experiences. This gap makes it difficult for users to track their progress accurately, receive feedback on form, and stay motivated during their at-home workouts.

<h2>The Solution</h2>

Flextally addresses these challenges by providing an intuitive web-based fitness tracking platform that utilizes computer vision technology to offer real-time workout recognition and feedback. Using OpenCV and Mediapipe for pose detection, the app can accurately track predefined exercises such as push-ups, squats, and jumping jacks without requiring additional equipment. The platform provides real-time repetition counts, form correction feedback, and goal tracking, ensuring a safe and effective fitness experience. By eliminating the need for wearables and leveraging a user-friendly interface accessible via webcam, Flextally empowers users to enhance their fitness journey conveniently from the comfort of their homes.
